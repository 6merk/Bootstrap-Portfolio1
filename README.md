# Bootstrap-Portfolio1

I ran in to many problems doing this assignment. At first I wasn't using a CSS file to implement the style changes and was doing it all in on the html file itself. After messing around with CSS things took a wrong turn and started to fall apart. I'm going to go back over it today and try to complete the assignment in full.
